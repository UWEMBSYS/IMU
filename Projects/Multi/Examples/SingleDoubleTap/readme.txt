@par Example Description 

Main function is to show how to detect the single and double tap events using the sensor expansion board and a STM32 Nucleo board.
After application is started, the user can try to tap the STM32 Nucleo board; when the single tap is detected,
the LED is switched on for a while. Press the user button to pass from the single tap detection to the double tap detection feature.
When the double tap is detected, the LED is switched on twice for a while. Press again the user button to disable the single/double tap detection feature.
Press the user button to enable again the single tap detection feature and so on. 


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on Sensor expansion board attached to STM32F401RE, STM32L053R8, STM32L152RE and STM32L476RG devices.
  - You must need the LSM6DS3 DIL24 expansion component to run this example. The example does not work without this component.
    If the LSM6DS3 DIL24 expansion component is not detected the LED will be always switched on.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F401RE RevC, NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC, NUCLEO-L152RE RevC
    and NUCLEO-L476RG RevC and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz. IAR, µVision and and System Workbench. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V7.40.3).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.eww or EWARM\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Project.eww or EWARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.eww
   or EWARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.eww according the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For µVision:
 - Open µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been 
   successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.16a).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or MDK-ARM\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or MDK-ARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx
   or MDK-ARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx according the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For System Workbench:
 - Open System Workbench for STM32 (this firmware has been 
   successfully tested with System Workbench for STM32 Version 1.7.0.20160212).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the System
   Workbench project is located (it should be SW4STM32\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\STM32F4xx-Nucleo-SingleDoubleTap or
   SW4STM32\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\STM32L0xx-Nucleo-SingleDoubleTap or SW4STM32\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\STM32L1xx-Nucleo-SingleDoubleTap
   or SW4STM32\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\STM32L4xx-Nucleo-SingleDoubleTap according the target board used). 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
