@par Example Description 

Main function is to show how to use sensor expansion board to send data from a Nucleo board 
using UART to a connected PC or Desktop and display it on generic applications like 
TeraTerm and specific application like Sensors_DataLog, which is developed by STMicroelectronics 
and provided in binary with this package.
After connection has been established:
- the user can view the data from various on-board environment sensors like Temperature, 
Humidity, and Pressure.
- the user can also view data from various on-board MEMS sensors as well like Accelerometer,
Gyroscope, and Magnetometer.
- the user can also visualize this data as graphs using Sensors_DataLog application provided
with this package.


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on Sensor expansion board attached to STM32F401RE, STM32L053R8, STM32L152RE and STM32L476RG devices.
  - If you power the Nucleo board via USB 3.0 port, please check that you have flashed the last version of
    the firmware of ST-Link v2 inside the Nucleo board. In order to flash the last available firmware of the 
	ST-Link v2, you can use the STM32 ST Link Utility.
  - If you have the DIL24 expansion component with the LSM6DS3 sensor and you want to enable the LSM6DS3 sensor,
    plug the component into the DIL24 interface; otherwise the LSM6DS0 sensor is enabled by default.
  - If you have the DIL24 expansion component with the LPS25HB sensor and you want to enable the LPS25HB sensor,
    plug the component into the DIL24 interface; otherwise the LPS25H/B onboard sensor is enabled by default.
  - If you have the DIL24 expansion component with the LPS22HB sensor and you want to enable the LPS22HB sensor,
    plug the component into the DIL24 interface; otherwise the LPS25H/B onboard sensor is enabled by default.
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F401RE RevC, NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC and NUCLEO-L152RE RevC
    and NUCLEO-L476RG RevC and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    

@par How to use it ? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz. IAR, µVision and System Workbench. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - WARNING: this sample application is only compatible with the Sensors_DataLog PC utility version 1.4.0 or higher;
   it does not work with previous versions of the Sensors_DataLog application.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V7.40.3).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.eww or EWARM\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Project.eww or EWARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.eww
   or EWARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.eww according the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For µVision:
 - Open µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been 
   successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.16a).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or MDK-ARM\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx or MDK-ARM\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx
   or MDK-ARM\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Project.uvprojx according the target board used.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For System Workbench:
 - Open System Workbench for STM32 (this firmware has been 
   successfully tested with System Workbench for STM32 Version 1.7.0.20160212).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the System
   Workbench project is located (it should be SW4STM32\STM32F401RE-Nucleo\STM32F4xx-Nucleo-DataLog or SW4STM32\STM32L053R8-Nucleo\STM32L0xx-Nucleo-DataLog
   or SW4STM32\STM32L152RE-Nucleo\STM32L1xx-Nucleo-DataLog  or SW4STM32\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\STM32L4xx-Nucleo-DataLog according the target board used). 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
